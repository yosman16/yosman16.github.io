                <li>Recipe Website</li>
                <p>This website was created as part of a university coursework project and serves as a recipe website. Its main features include a user-friendly interface that allows users to search for recipes, add recipes to a virtual basket, create an account, and complete transactions. One of the key aspects of this website is the integration of a database, which plays a crucial role in facilitating interactions and data storage.
                Through the implementation of a database, the website enables seamless communication between the user interface and the backend. The database stores various data, such as user account information, recipe details, and transaction records. This allows users to create accounts, securely store personal information, access saved recipes, and complete transactions with ease.

                <li>Unity Platformer Game</li>
                <p>I developed a Unity platformer game with three challenging levels. Players must skillfully navigate obstacles, collect items, and manage limited jumps to progress. Strategic thinking is crucial as each level presents unique puzzles requiring precise execution and careful planning. The game's combination of platforming skills and strategic decision-making offers an immersive and rewarding experience. To reach a wider audience, I uploaded the game to itch.io, a popular indie game platform. This enables players worldwide to discover and enjoy the game, fostering a community and gathering valuable feedback for future enhancements.

                <li>Outliner Application</li>
                <p>For my coursework, I developed an outliner/task manager with powerful functionalities. Users can create task lists, add subtasks, and tag items for completion. Custom tags can be created to enhance organization. The system allows users to search tasks based on tags, dates, and names, enabling efficient task retrieval. With this outliner, users can easily manage and track their tasks, ensuring productivity and effective time management.
                </p>
                <li>Password Generator</li>
                <p>I developed a password generator website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, while leveraging Python for the backend scripting. This dynamic website allows users to generate strong and secure passwords with ease. The HTML structure provides the content layout, CSS enhances the visual styling, JavaScript adds interactivity, and Python handles the password generation logic behind the scenes.
